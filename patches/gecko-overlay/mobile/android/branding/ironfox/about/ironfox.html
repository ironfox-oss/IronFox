      <p id="moztext">And so, the <em>Mole</em> had fallen. As the <em>Beast</em> had already lost its way, the believers began to lose faith, and the world was left in <em class="f">darkness</em>. As hope was almost lost, a <em>Fox</em> created a <em class="f">spark</em>. Drawn to its <em class="f">light</em>, a <em>Phoenix</em> bonded with the <em>Fox</em> to form a special coat of <em>Iron</em>. With its newfound <em class="f">strength</em>, the creature rose to <em class="f">avenge</em> the <em>Mole</em> and the <em>Beast</em> that fell before it.</p>
