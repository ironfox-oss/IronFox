## App Installation

Currently, you can install IronFox from [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/app/org.ironfoxoss.ironfox), from your preferred F-Droid client via our [F-Droid repository](fdroidrepos://fdroid.ironfoxoss.org/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=C5E291B5A571F9C8CD9A9799C2C94E02EC9703948893F2CA756D67B94204F904), with [Obtainium](obtainium://app/%7B%22id%22%3A%22org.ironfoxoss.ironfox%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2Fironfox-oss%2Fironfox%22%2C%22author%22%3A%22ironfox-oss%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22ironfox%22%2C%22preferredApkIndex%22%3A0%2C%22additionalSettings%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22fallbackToOlderReleases%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22trackOnly%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22versionExtractionRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22matchGroupToUse%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22versionDetection%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22releaseDateAsVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22useVersionCodeAsOSVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22apkFilterRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22invertAPKFilter%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22autoApkFilterByArch%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22appName%5C%22%3A%5C%22IronFox%5C%22%2C%5C%22shizukuPretendToBeGooglePlay%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22allowInsecure%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22exemptFromBackgroundUpdates%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22skipUpdateNotifications%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22about%5C%22%3A%5C%22A%20privacy%20and%20security-oriented%20Firefox-based%20browser%20for%20Android.%5C%22%2C%5C%22refreshBeforeDownload%5C%22%3Afalse%7D%22%2C%22overrideSource%22%3A%22GitLab%22%7D), or directly from our [GitLab releases](https://gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/IronFox/-/releases).

**The most secure way to install IronFox is from [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/) - and this is the installation method we recommend most users use.** Accrescent is a new and upcoming, free and open source Android app store - with a focus on privacy & security _(See [here](https://accrescent.app/features) for a list of some of Accrescent's key features)_. It's currently used by other privacy and security-focused projects, such as [Molly](https://molly.im/), and recommended for use by [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), among other privacy and security-focused projects and researchers.

Regardless of your installation method, we recommend verifying Ironfox's package ID and the checksum of its signing certificate. You can simplify this process using [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier), which also has easy integration with Obtainium. **See [App Verification](#app-verification) below for IronFox's Package ID & SHA-256 of the signing certificate.**

If you are using F-Droid, we recommend [F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic/) as your client of choice. Due to its reduced feature set, F-Droid Basic has less attack surface; meaning it is generally more secure than the standard client.

It should be noted that our F-Droid repo is hosted using Cloudflare's R2 Storage _(under the EU jurisdiction)_. While not perfect, Cloudflare does have a [strong privacy track record](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/quad9-or-cloudflare/15744/9), and due to their high reliabity and performance, we feel this is the best option for most users.

That being said, if you'd rather avoid Cloudflare, we also host a mirror of the F-Droid repo on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ironfox-oss/fdroid), though it comes at the cost of lower reliability & performance. You can add the following link to your F-Droid client:

```sh
https://codeberg.org/ironfox-oss/fdroid/raw/branch/main/fdroid/repo
```

Once added, within the repository's settings on F-Droid, you can disable the other mirrors & leave Codeberg as the only selected option.

We also mirror the F-Droid repo on GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/fdroid). You can add the following link to your F-Droid client if desired:

```sh
https://gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/fdroid/-/raw/main/fdroid/repo
```

## App Verification

**Package ID**: `org.ironfoxoss.ironfox`

**SHA-256 Hash of Signing Certificate**:

```sh
C5:E2:91:B5:A5:71:F9:C8:CD:9A:97:99:C2:C9:4E:02:EC:97:03:94:88:93:F2:CA:75:6D:67:B9:42:04:F9:04
```

## Building

IronFox makes it easier (and faster) to build the project locally.
For example, prebuilt versions of wasi-sdk sysroot and llvm-project are used instead of building them locally. ~~F-Droid builds still build those from source.~~

**It is recommended to use the Docker image for building IronFox.**

### Build with Docker

Pull the docker image with :

```sh
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/ironfox:latest
```

You can also use the `main` tag to pull the image which was used to
build the latest IronFox release. Or you can use exact version names
to pull images for those versions.

For example :

```
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/ironfox:v135-0
```

Then, you need to [set up the source files](#get--patch-sources).

### Build without Docker

You need to install a few packages on your machine to be able to build IronFox.
Follow the below instructions based on the OS you're using.

<details>
<summary>When building on Ubuntu</summary>

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make \
        cmake \
        clang-18 \
        gyp \
        nasm \
        ninja-build \
        patch \
        perl \
        tar \
        unzip \
        wget \
        xz-utils \
        yq \
        zlib1g-dev
```

Apart from the above packages, you need to install Python 3.9. You can use [PPA from the `deadsnakes` team](https://launchpad.net/%7Edeadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

You will also need to install JDK 8 **AND** JDK 17, with JDK 17 set as the default JDK.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When building on Fedora 42</summary>

```sh
sudo dnf install -y \
    cmake \
    clang \
    gawk \
    git \
    gyp \
    m4 \
    make \
    nasm \
    ninja-build \
    patch \
    perl \
    python3.9 \
    shasum \
    wget \
    xz \
    yq \
    zlib-devel
```

You will also need to install JDK 8 **AND** JDK 17, with JDK 17 set as the default JDK. These can be installed from [The Adoptium Working Group's repository](https://adoptium.net/installation/linux/#_centosrhelfedora_instructions).

To add The Adoptium Working Group's repository, you'll want to install Fedora's `adoptium-temurin-java-repository` package and enable the repository:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y adoptium-temurin-java-repository
sudo dnf config-manager setopt adoptium-temurin-java-repository.enabled=1
sudo dnf makecache
```

Now, to install JDK 8 & 17:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y temurin-8-jdk temurin-17-jdk
```

</details>

Once the packages have been installed successfully, follow the instructions to set up the build environment:

- Setup F-Droid's `gradle` script to be available in your `PATH`:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p $HOME/bin
  wget https://gitlab.com/fdroid/gradlew-fdroid/-/raw/main/gradlew-fdroid -O "$HOME/bin/gradle"
  chmod +x "$HOME/bin/gradle"

  export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```

- Disable Gradle Daemons and configuration cache:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p ~/.gradle
  echo "org.gradle.daemon=false" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
  echo "org.gradle.configuration-cache=false" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
  ```

- Create a new Python 3.9 virtual environment, then activate it:

  ```sh
  python3.9 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

- Ensure JDK 17 is the default JDK. You can check the current JDK version by running `java --version` in the terminal. Otherwise, you can temporarily set JDK 17 as the default by running:

  **Don't forget to replace `/path/to/jdk-17` below with the actual path of your JDK 17 installation!**

  ```sh
  export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-17
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```

  For instance, on **Fedora 42**, the default location of JDK 17 is `/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-17-jdk`:

  ```sh
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-17-jdk
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```

- Ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` variable points to a valid Android SDK installation (default location is `$HOME/android-sdk`). Otherwise, you can execute the following to install and set up the SDK:

  ```sh
  source ./scripts/setup-android-sdk.sh
  ```

### Get & patch sources

Next, you need to download the source files to build. The `scripts/get_sources.sh` file can be used to download/clone the source files.

_This may take some time depending on your network speed..._

```sh
./scripts/get_sources.sh
```

If you need to fetch sources for a different version of Firefox than the one IronFox is currently based on, you'll have to modify the script directly.

Once the source files are downloaded and extracted, you need to source the
`scripts/env_local.sh` script _(generated by `get_sources.sh`)_ to set up the required environment variables:

```sh
source scripts/env_local.sh
```

Next, you need to patch the files with:

_This must be run once after getting your sources._

```sh
./scripts/prebuild.sh <build-variant>
```

Where `<build-variant>` specifies the variant to build, and is **one** of the following:

- `arm` - 32-bit ARM (`armeabi-v7a`)
- `arm64` - 64-bit ARM (`arm64-v8a`)
- `x86_64` - 64-bit x86
- `bundle` - Android App Bundle (AAB) with all supported ABIs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to build the `bundle` variant locally, you need to build the ABI-specific
> variants first, get the generated AAR file for GeckoView and then configure
> `MOZ_ANDROID_FAT_AAR*` environment variables with the path to the generate AAR files.
>
> See [task kinds](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/taskcluster/kinds.html#build-fat-aar) and [ci-build.sh](./scripts/ci-build.sh) for more details.

### Build

Finally, you can start the build process with:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh apk
```
